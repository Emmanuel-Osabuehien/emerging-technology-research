# Playing with Jupyter

This is a repository which exists to contain the research I used to obtain the knowledge of running juptyer notebooks and also to learn the python scikit-learn library where I learned about all the libraries that come with it including NumPy Matplotlib and Pandas, I used this research to show the different algorithms that can be built using scikit-learn, e.g. Handwritten Digits Recognition, Iris Classification, Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.

These algorithms can be found in the GitHub repostitory: [https://github.com/Emmanuel-Osabuehien/EmergingTechnologyProject,<br> https://github.com/Emmanuel-Osabuehien/EmergingTechnologyProject/)

If the link dosen't work than the GitHub repository is set to private.
